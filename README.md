This is the home of Marvin the Destiny 2 clan discord bot which has a ton of features such as item and title broadcasts and leaderboards for both clannies and global.

**[Clans](https://marvin.gg/clans)**
Every clan that Marvin is tracking / has tracked can be found on this page, It's intended use case is to help users find and join new clans to help them keep them active and help connect people together whom otherwise may not have found that perfect group of friends yet.

**[Mobile](https://marvin.gg)**
I had noticed that quite a fair bit of traffic coming to the site was from mobile users, so i created a mobile css layout for each page for those group of people. Hope they enjoy it much better than it was before.

**[LiveTracking](https://marvin.gg)**
In order to maintain that perfect 24/7 uptime, I built a system to monitor Marvin's status to make sure he is performing at the highest capacity without breaking the set request limit defined by the Bungie API guidelines.

**[Graphs](https://marvin.gg)**
There is a few other miscellaneous graphs that track over time growth to help me gauge things like user activity and progressive growth. (The dip in users that can be seen is usually due to Discord purging inactive users, typical stuff)
